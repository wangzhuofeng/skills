This is the skills in my Obsidian Vault / .codex (or .claude) / skills

It's used to automate my 2nd brain system.

Principle: Make the input process as easy as possible, don't burder yourself with "post process" thought such as where to categorize this note etc.

This is my usual workflow:
1. I speak to a note taking app about some random thought, and put the text in a Time Signatured Title file. (e.g. 202601110810-My Random Thought.md), which locates in my obsidian vault folder root level.

2. I start codex (or claude) at my Obsidian Vault folder. And type in "Process my note of today / this week / this month"

3. Codex will start processing my unstructured note and do the following: (more functions to be added)
   1. If a person is mentioned, create / update the person note in "People" folder, and link to this thought
   2. If a "knowledge card" can be created, create the knowledge card follow by my knowledge card principles and add to my knowledge card folder.
   3. more coming...
